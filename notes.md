### Notes
- I'm not lazy, I'm on energy-saving mode.
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.
- I told my computer I needed a break, and it said: 'Error 404: Motivation not found.'
- Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.
- To err is human, to really foul things up requires a computer.
